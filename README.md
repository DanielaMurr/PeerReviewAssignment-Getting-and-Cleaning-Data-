Dataset:

Contained Files: 

CodeBook.md 
-> this markdown files explain the variables, the data and the transformations that are performed to clean up the data according to the instructions of the assignment 

run_analysis.R 
-> first the data set is downloaded and prepared for the analysis (tidying up), secondly the five steps required for the assignment are exerted. The five steps noted in the assignment are the following: 
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

FinalData.txt 
-> This text file is the exported final (tidy) data after each of the five steps above have been exerted
